# EmoChat CNN and LSTM Prediction Model

This project was built for the CS6101 Deep Learning Steps Project. We aim to make use of the Twitter data and predict the desired emoji based on the Tweets text. Two models are constructed and we do a comparative study: a 2-layer CNN and a 2-layer LSTM.

## Pre-requisites

The model was built based on Keras (with Tensorflow backend; you may also use PyTorch as well), emoji and gensim. You may want to install those dependencies to test the code.


## Files

For now we only include the CNN model, word vector trainer, and the Jupyter Notebook for live demo. You may refer to cnn.py for more details on the construction of CNN model. The details of the neural networks (CNN and LSTM) can be found inside the Jupyter Notebook.
